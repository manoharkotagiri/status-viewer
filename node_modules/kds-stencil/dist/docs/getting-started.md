Yarn:

```bash
yarn add kds-stencil
```

NPM:

```bash
npm install --save kds-stencil
```

## React Installation

Framework bindings are now available for ReactJS via the `kds-stencil-react` package.

As with other ReactJS component libraries, simply import the component you wish to use directly from `kds-stencil-react`.

```jsx
import { KdsButton, KdsCheckbox, ...KdsComponents } from 'kds-stencil-react'
```

## Angular Installation

Adapted from [StencilJS's Angular Framework Integration Docs](https://stenciljs.com/docs/angular)

Using a Stencil built web component collection within an Angular CLI project is a two-step process.

1. Include the CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA in the modules that use the components.
2. Call `defineCustomElements(window)` within main.ts.
  a. (Optional) Call `applyPolyfills().then(() => defineCustomElements(window))` if your application needs to support legacy browsers.

### Including the Custom Elements Schema

`CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA` needs to be included in any module that uses custom elements. Here is an example of adding it to AppModule:

```js
import { BrowserModule } from "@angular/platform-browser";
import { CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA, NgModule } from "@angular/core";
import { FormsModule } from "@angular/forms";

import { AppComponent } from "./app.component";
import { SharedModule } from "./shared/shared.module";

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule, FormsModule, SharedModule],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
  schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

### Calling defineCustomElements

A component collection built with Stencil includes a main function that is used to load the components in the collection. That function is called `defineCustomElements()` and it needs to be called once during the bootstrapping of your application. One convenient place to do this is in main.ts:

```js
import { enableProdMode } from "@angular/core";
import { platformBrowserDynamic } from "@angular/platform-browser-dynamic";

import { AppModule } from "./app/app.module";
import { environment } from "./environments/environment";

import { defineCustomElements } from "kds-stencil/dist/loader";
/* OR for legacy browser support...
import { defineCustomElements, applyPolyfills } from "kds-stencil/dist/loader";
*/

if (environment.production) {
  enableProdMode();
}

platformBrowserDynamic()
  .bootstrapModule(AppModule)
  .catch(err => console.log(err));

defineCustomElements(window);
/* OR for legacy browser support...
applyPolyfills().then(() => defineCustomElements(window));
*/

```

## Importing CSS

While most styles are bundled with each component, kds-stencil relies on the inclusion of three global stylesheets to properly render each component.

### kds-reset.css

The first stylesheet is the KDS standard reset, based off of normalize and some KDS specific rules. The purpose of this reset is to ensure KDS components are visually consistent across consuming applications.

The kds-reset stylesheet is located at one of the following locations:
* kds-stencil: `kds-stencil/dist/kds-reset.css`.
* kds-stencil-react: `kds-stencil-react/dist/kds-reset.css`.

This reset also contains font declarations for all headings that introduce Nunito. These fonts are bundled with kds-stencil and can be found under `kds-stencil/dist/fonts`.

### kds-components.css

The second stylesheet is needed to support the components built using CSS and HTML alone. This stylesheet should be placed after any reset stylesheet your project uses, but before kds-utils.css to ensure the appropriate styles don't get overwritten.

The kds-components stylesheet is located at one of the following locations:
* kds-stencil: `kds-stencil/dist/kds-components.css`.
* kds-stencil-react: `kds-stencil-react/dist/kds-components.css`

### kds-utils.css

The third stylesheet defines all of the [CSS utility classes](react/components/about-css-utilities) used to style a number of kds-stencil components. These utility classes are also used to give consumers an easy way to style their pages and components closer to the KDS. We provide a [CSS utility class reference](stencil/components/css-utilities-reference) for easy class discovery.

The kds-utils stylesheet is located at one of the following locations:
* kds-stencil: `kds-stencil/dist/kds-utils.css`.
* kds-stencil-react: `kds-stencil-react/dist/kds-utils.css`.

~~~markdown { "props": { "heading": "Component Usage" } }
Components created with StencilJS are compiled into Web Components that can be consumed in a variety of frameworks (or none at all). Therefore, using these components is similar to using any native HTML element in your respective framework.

## Usage in React

After following the [installation instructions for React](#React%20Installation), simply add the desired Stencil component to your JSX.

> **Note:** In the current version of React, there are a number of caveats to consuming web components in a React application. Specifically, the way React [handles data](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/#react-handling-data) as well as [events](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/#react-handling-events) leads to some potential pitfalls when integrating web components. The React framework bindings in `kds-stencil-react` utilize React component wrappers to solve these problems.

```jsx
<KdsButton
  kind={buttonKind}
  compact={true}
  name={buttonName}
  disabled={buttonDisabled}
  onClick={() => alert("Button Clicked!")}
>
  Stencil Button in React
</KdsButton>
```

## Usage in Angular

After following the [installation instructions for Angular](#Angular%20Installation), you can start using Stencil components in your HTML templates.

```html
<kds-button
  [kind]="buttonKind"
  [compact]="isCompact"
  [name]="buttonName"
  [disabled]="isDisabled"
  (click)="handleButtonClick()"
>
  Stencil Button in Angular
</kds-button>
```

### Note to Angular KIC users
Angular projects based off of the KIC seed will need to remove the `@webcomponents/custom-elements` polyfill from their project. This polyfill is automatically added by kds-stencil and causes rendering issues in Microsoft Edge when both are present.

To fix kds-stencil components in Microsoft Edge, follow these steps:

1. Remove `@webcomponents/custom-elements` from your package.json dependencies.
2. Remove `"node_modules/@webcomponents/custom-elements/custom-elements.min.js"` from all script lists in `angular.json`
3. Ensure kds-stencil is properly installed in your project as described in [Angular Installation](#Angular%20Installation). (Ensure you are using `applyPolyfills` in your main.ts)

~~~markdown { "props": { "heading": "Angular Accessors" } }

KDS web components that take the place of native elements such as `<kds-button>`, `<kds-select>`, and `<kds-checkbox>`, are not extensions of their native counterparts. For this reason, custom accessors need to be defined for these components to work with Angular Forms and ngModel.

If you need to consume one of these KDS web components with Angular Forms and/or ngModel, you will need to install the `kds-stencil-accessors` module. When installing `kds-stencil-accessors`, ensure your version of `kds-stencil` adheres to the peer dependency in `kds-stencil-accessors`'s package.json.

> **Note:** For `<kds-input>`, simply define `ngDefaultControl` as an attribute before using `formControl`, `formControlName`, or `ngModel`.

## Installing Accessors

Yarn:

```bash
yarn install kds-stencil-accessors
```

NPM:

```bash
npm install --save kds-stencil-accessors
```

## Importing the Accessors Module
```typescript
import { KdsStencilAccessorsModule } from 'kds-stencil-accessors'

@NgModule({
  declarations: [...],
  imports: [ KdsStencilAccessorsModule ],
  providers: [...],
  bootstrap: [...],
  schemas: [...])
export class YourModule {}
```
