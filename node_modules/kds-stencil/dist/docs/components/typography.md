Instead of providing web components for typography, KDS Stencil offers a set of component classes. This provides structure and flexibility without the overhead of additional host elements in the Document Object Model (DOM).
~~~

Typography component classes are styled to meet KDS typography standards.

Component classes differ from other utility classes (See: [CSS Utilities Reference](stencil/components/css-utilities-reference)) in two primary ways:

1. They extend and/or apply other utility styles.
2. The names follow the [SUIT CSS naming convention](https://github.com/suitcss/suit/blob/master/doc/naming-conventions.md).

~~~markdown { "props": { "heading": "Headings", "playground": "true"} }

```html noeditor { "className" : "LiveProvider--noBorder" }
<div class="relative w-full text-left table-collapse mb-48 border-t border-b border-default-400 UtilitiesTableWrapper">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Class</th>
        <th>Properties</th>
      </tr>

    <tbody class="align-top">

        <td><code>.kds-Heading</code></td>
        <td>
          <code>@extend line-length; @apply font-400 mb-16</code>
          <p class="kds-Paragraph kds-Paragraph--s mt-8 mb-0">Heading base. Apply to all heading tags. Must be paired with <code>kds-Heading--{'{size}'}</code>.</p>

          <p class="kds-Paragraph kds-Paragraph--s mt-8 mb-0">Add to base class for medium size and corresponding line-height.</p>

          <p class="kds-Paragraph kds-Paragraph--s mt-8 mb-0">Add to base class for extra small size and corresponding line-height.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
```

## Headings common usage

Classes for any heading size can be used with any `h1â€“h6` level, but size often indicates level and these are common pairings.

```html
<h1 class="kds-Heading kds-Heading--xl">Heading X-Large, h1, 2rem / 32px</h1>
<h1 class="kds-Heading kds-Heading--l">Heading Large, h1, 1.25rem / 20px</h1>
<h2 class="kds-Heading kds-Heading--m">Heading Medium, h2, 1.125rem / 18px</h2>
<h3 class="kds-Heading kds-Heading--s">Heading Small, h3, 1rem / 16px, bold</h3>
```

# Paragraph for long-form text

Paragraphs are used to render blocks of text for long-form reading, which here means one or more complete sentences.

Paragraph component classes are styled to meet [KDS typography standards](/stencil/style/typography), which includes applying `min-width` and `max-width` to control line-length for readability.

```html noeditor { "className" : "LiveProvider--noBorder" }
<div class="relative w-full text-left table-collapse mb-48 border-t border-b border-default-400 UtilitiesTableWrapper">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Class</th>
        <th>Properties</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody class="align-top">
      <tr>
        <td><code>.kds-Paragraph</code></td>
        <td>
          <code>@extend line-length; @apply font-400 mb-16</code>
          <p class="kds-Paragraph kds-Paragraph--s mt-8 mb-0">Paragraph base. Apply to all paragraph tags. Must be paired with <code>kds-Paragraph--{'{size}'}</code>.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>.kds-Paragraph--l</code></td>
        <td>
          <code>@apply body-l leading-body-l</code>
          <p class="kds-Paragraph kds-Paragraph--s mt-8 mb-0">Add to base class for large size and corresponding line-height.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>.kds-Paragraph--m</code></td>
        <td>
          <code>@apply body-m leading-body-m</code>
          <p class="kds-Paragraph kds-Paragraph--s mt-8 mb-0">Add to base class for medium size and corresponding line-height.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>.kds-Paragraph--s</code></td>
        <td>
          <code>@apply body-s leading-body-s</code>
          <p class="kds-Paragraph kds-Paragraph--s mt-8 mb-0">Add to base class for small size and corresponding line-height.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>.kds-Paragraph--xs</code></td>
        <td>
          <code>@apply body-xs leading-body-xs</code>
          <p class="kds-Paragraph kds-Paragraph--s mt-8 mb-0">Add to base class for extra small size and corresponding line-height.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
```

## Paragraph with size

```html
<p class="kds-Paragraph kds-Paragraph--l">
  <strong>Large, 1rem (16px) (default):</strong><br />
  With tenure, Suzie would have all the more leisure for yachting, <em>but her publications are no good</em>. The beige hue on the waters of the loch impressed all, including the French queen, before she heard that symphony again, just as young Arthur wanted.
</p>
<p class="kds-Paragraph kds-Paragraph--m">
  <strong>Medium, 0.844rem (13.5px):</strong><br />
  With tenure, Suzie would have all the more leisure for yachting, <em>but her publications are no good</em>. The beige hue on the waters of the loch impressed all, including the French queen, before she heard that symphony again, just as young Arthur wanted.
</p>
<p class="kds-Paragraph kds-Paragraph--s">
  <strong>Small, 0.75rem (12px):</strong><br />
  With tenure, Suzie would have all the more leisure for yachting, <em>but her publications are no good</em>. The beige hue on the waters of the loch impressed all, including the French queen, before she heard that symphony again, just as young Arthur wanted.
</p>
<p class="kds-Paragraph kds-Paragraph--xs">
  <strong>Extra Small, 0.625rem (10px):</strong><br />
  With tenure, Suzie would have all the more leisure for yachting, <em>but her publications are no good</em>. The beige hue on the waters of the loch impressed all, including the French queen, before she heardthat symphony again, just as young Arthur wanted.
</p>

## Applying line length to a group

Often you will have images and other elements interspersed with text and would like them clamped to the same width. Apply the utility class `line-length` to any element or wrap the entire group in a container and apply the utility class to the container to ensure all elements in the group have the same `min-` and `max-width`.

```html { "props": { "style": { "background": "#eaeced" } } }
<img alt="" class="line-length rounded-8 mb-16" src="http://design.kroger.com/static/media/hero-768px.d70bdb75.png" />
<section class="line-length">
  <img alt="" class="rounded-8 mb-16" src="http://kds.pages.kroger.com/kds-assets/design/images/design-standards.png" />
  <h2 class="kds-Heading kds-Heading--m">Design Standards</h2>
  <p class="kds-Paragraph kds-Paragraph--m mb-24">We design with accessibility in mind, beginning with wireframes and continuing through each phase of mockups and product development. We aim for the WCAG AA Standard for all of the experiences that our products provide.</p>
  <img alt="" class="rounded-8 mb-16" src="http://kds.pages.kroger.com/kds-assets/design/images/development-standards.png" />
  <h2 class="kds-Heading kds-Heading--m">Development Standards</h2>
  <p class="kds-Paragraph kds-Paragraph--m mb-0">Our code is written following best practices for accessibility and screen reader compatibility.</p>
</section>
```

## Dangerously opting-out of line length

In rare circumstances, the built-in `min-` and/or `max-width` values may adversely affect your ability to achieve some design. You may opt-out of line length by applying the utility class `line-length-off`. Before opting-out of line length, consult with your designer about possibly reducing the font-size and/or reworking the layout to allow for better readability.

```html { "props": { "style": { "background": "#eaeced" } } }
<div class="kds-Card mb-16">
  <p class="kds-Paragraph kds-Paragraph--l line-length-off mb-0">In wide containers, this paragraph may have more than 75 characters per line. It is bad practice to opt-out of line length to <em>fill</em> a container; instead let the container grow beyond the text.</p>
</div>

<section class="flex -m-8">
  <div class="kds-Card m-8">
    <p class="kds-Paragraph kds-Paragraph--l line-length-off">In narrow containers, at <code>size="l"</code>, this paragraph has fewer than 40 characters per line. Before opting-out of line length, consult with your designer about possibly reducing the font-size and/or reworking the layout to allow for better readability.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="kds-Card m-8">
    <p class="kds-Paragraph kds-Paragraph--l line-length-off">In narrow containers, at <code>size="l"</code>, this paragraph has fewer than 40 characters per line. Before opting-out of line length, consult with your designer about possibly reducing the font-size and/or reworking the layout to allow for better readability.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="kds-Card m-8">
    <p class="kds-Paragraph kds-Paragraph--l line-length-off">In narrow containers, at <code>size="l"</code>, this paragraph has fewer than 40 characters per line. Before opting-out of line length, consult with your designer about possibly reducing the font-size and/or reworking the layout to allow for better readability.</p>
  </div>
</section>

# Short-form text

For short texts â€” such as that which often appear in data tables and content cards; or segments of long-form text that need special styles â€” consider combining relevant typography utility classes with any element as needed. See: [CSS Utilities Reference](stencil/components/css-utilities-reference)

```html
<section class="line-length">
  <h1 class="kds-Heading kds-Heading--s text-center">Big Data</h1>
  <hr class="mt-0 mb-16 border-default-800" />
  <table class="w-full body-m">
    <thead class="border-b border-default-400">
      <tr>
        <th class="font-400 body-l text-left p-4">Name</th>
        <th class="font-400 body-l text-right p-4">Price</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td class="font-700 p-4 italic">Item 1</td>
        <td class="font-700 font-mono text-right text-negative-400 p-4">â€“$1.00</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="p-4 italic">Item 2</td>
        <td class="font-mono text-right p-4">$0.49</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="p-4 italic">Item 3</td>
        <td class="font-mono text-right p-4">$2.98</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</section>
```
