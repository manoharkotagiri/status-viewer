Primitive web components built using StencilJS are designed to match their native HTML counterparts as closely as possible. However, since StencilJS has yet to support [extending built-in elements](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/customelements#extendhtml), there are a few differences between web components and the HTML elements they represent.

~~~markdown { "props" : { "heading": "Host Elements" } }
Web components are all wrapped by what is often referred to as a `host element`. For primitives in kds-stencil, this means that the actual native element is wrapped inside of its own host element.

#### The component before hydration
```html no-playground
<kds-button>Test Button</kds-button>
```

#### The component after hydration
```html no-playground
<kds-button class="hydrated">
  <button class="kds-Button">Test Button</button>
</kds-button>
```

The host element is the main point of interaction for consumers of the component. Props defined for each component can be set as attributes on the host element, or as a property on the ref of a host element.

#### Setting a Prop as an attribute
```html no-playground
<kds-button compact></kds-button>
```

#### Setting a Prop as a property
```javascript
const kdsButton = document.querySelector('kds-button')
kdsButton.compact = true;
```

~~~markdown { "props": { "heading" : "Native/Inner Attributes" } }
The props of a primitive web component contain a subset of attributes and properties from their native counterpart. For example, `<kds-input>` accepts a subset of `<input>` attributes and `<kds-button>` accepts a subset of `<button>` attributes.

Primitives will also accept attributes starting with an `inner-` prefix and apply them to the rendered native element without the prefix. This feature is provided for defining attributes that should not be present on both host and native element (i.e `id`, `class`, `role`, etc), or for setting other global HTML attributes on the inner native element (i.e `aria-*` attributes).

#### The following example shows a hydrated `kds-input` with `props` and `inner-` attributes applied
```jsx no-playground
<kds-input 
  class="hydrated" 
  inner-class="customClass" // inner attribute
  inner-id="inputId" // inner attribute
  inner-aria-label="Input Label" // inner attribute
  placeholder="standard size" // prop
  name="input name" // prop
  maxlength="15" // prop
  id="hostInputId"
  >
  <input 
    class="customClass" // set by inner-class
    aria-label="Input Label" // set by inner-aria-label
    placeholder="standard size" // set by `placeholder` prop
    name="input name" // set by `name` prop
    id="inputId" // set by inner-id
    maxlength="15" // set by `maxlength` prop
    />
</kds-input>
```
~~~
~~~markdown { "props": { "heading" : "CSS Classes" } }
You can set a class on the host element as well as the internal native element. Set classes on the host element by using the `class` attribute, and set classes on the native element with the `inner-class` attribute:

#### The component before hydration
```html no-playground
<kds-button inner-class="customButtonClass" class="customHostClass">
  Test Button
</kds-button>
```

#### The component after hydration
```html no-playground
<kds-button class="hydrated customHostClass" inner-class="customButtonClass">
  <button class="customButtonClass">Test Button</button>
</kds-button>
```
~~~
~~~markdown { "props": { "heading" : "Inline Styles" } }
Both the host element and native element can receive inline styles. To set styles on the host element, set the `style` attribute. Use `inner-style` to set styles on the inner native element.

#### The component before hydration
```html no-playground
<kds-button
  style="border: 1px solid black"
  inner-style="background: blue"
>
  Test Button
</kds-button>
```

#### The component after hydration
```html no-playground
<kds-button 
  class="hydrated"
  style="border: 1px solid black"
  inner-style="background: blue"
>
  <button class="kds-Button" style="background: blue">Test Button</button>
</kds-button>
```
~~~
~~~markdown { "props": { "heading" : "Default HTML Attributes" } }
To help ensure proper dictation by screen readers, we default some global HTML attribute values on the host element. The current default is `role="presentation"`.

Naturally, you may still want to set these attributes on the underlying native element. To allow for this, simply prefix the desired attribute with `inner-`.

#### The component before hydration
```html no-playground
<kds-button inner-role="button">
  test button
</kds-button>
```

#### The component after hydration
```html no-playground
<kds-button class="hydrated" inner-role="button" role="presentation">
  <button class="kds-Button" role="button">test button</button>
</kds-button>
```
~~~
~~~markdown { "props": { "heading" : "Native Element Properties & Refs" } }
There may be a case where you want to set a property on a native element that is not defined as a prop on the web component. In such cases, setting the property on the host element will fail.

#### INVALID
```javascript
const hostRef = document.querySelector('kds-component')
hostRef.nonReflectedProperty = some_value // Will not be set on the native element
```

Instead, all primitive components expose their native element in three ways: The `getNativeElement` method, in a custom `ready` event, or a `nativeElement` property on the host element after the component is loaded.

> **Note:** Methods to get the native element return a promise.

#### Via method
```javascript
document.querySelector('kds-primitive')
  .getNativeElement()
  .then( (nativeElement) => {
    nativeElement.nonReflectedProperty = some_value
})
```

#### Via custom `ready` event
```javascript
const hostRef = document.querySelector('kds-primitive')
hostRef.addEventListener('ready', ({ detail: nativeElement }) => {
  nativeElement.nonReflectedProperty = some_value
})
```

#### Via host element after component is loaded/hydrated
```javascript
const hostRef = document.querySelector('kds-primitive')
const nativeElement = hostRef.nativeElement
nativeElement.nonReflectedProperty = some_value
```
