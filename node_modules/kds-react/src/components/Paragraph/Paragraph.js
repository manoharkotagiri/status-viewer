 * `<Paragraph>` is used to render blocks of text for long-form reading, which here means one or more complete sentences.
 * For short texts — such as that which often appears in product, coupon, and recipe cards — consider using `<Text>`.
 *
 * Paragraph renders a `<p>` tag styled to meet [KDS typography standards](/react/style/typography), which includes applying `min-width` and `max-width` to control line-length for readability.
 *
 * > **Note:** `<Paragraph>` spreads on all provided props: `<p {...props} />`.
 * > So you can pass to it any props or attributes: `aria-*`, `className`, `id`, etc.
