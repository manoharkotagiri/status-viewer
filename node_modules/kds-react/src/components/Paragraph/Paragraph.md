## Applying line length to a group

When appearing below a heading and/or in groups with other related text, wrap the entire group in a container and apply the utility class `line-length` to the container to ensure all text in the group have the same `min-` and `max-width`.

```jsx
<section className="line-length">
  <Heading size="l" tag="h1">Kroger Pickup (Formerly ClickList®) <abbr title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</abbr></Heading>
  <Heading size="s" tag="h2">What happens if I’m unable to receive my order on the day I’m scheduled to do so?</Heading>
  <Paragraph>If you're unable to pick up your order on the scheduled date, the items in your order will be restocked in the store, and you'll need to place your order again on the Pickup site.</Paragraph>
  
  <Heading size="s" tag="h2">I’ve placed my order for pickup. What do I do when I arrive at my pickup location?</Heading>
  <Paragraph>When you arrive at your store, follow the signs to the Pickup area. Call the number on the sign to let us know you’ve arrived. An Associate will bring your order out to your vehicle. We’ll load your groceries, and you’ll be on your way in minutes!</Paragraph>
</section>
```

## Dangerously opting-out of line length

In rare circumstances, the built-in `min-width` may adversely affect your ability to achieve some design. You may opt-out of line length by applying the utility class `line-length-off`. Before opting-out of line length, consult with your designer about possibly reducing the font-size and/or reflowing the layout to allow for better readability.

```jsx
<Paragraph className="line-length-off">In wide containers, this paragraph may have more than 75 characters per line. It is bad practice to opt-out of line length to <em>fill</em> a container; instead let the container grow beyond the text.</Paragraph>

<div className="flex -m-8">
  <div className="bg-default-100 px-8 py-4 m-8">
    <Paragraph className="line-length-off">In narrow containers, at <code>size="l"</code>, this paragraph has fewer than 40 characters per line. Before opting-out of line length, consult with your designer about possibly reducing the font-size and/or reflowing the layout to allow for better readability.</Paragraph>
  </div>
  <div className="bg-default-100 px-8 py-4 m-8">
    <Paragraph className="line-length-off">In narrow containers, at <code>size="l"</code>, this paragraph has fewer than 40 characters per line. Before opting-out of line length, consult with your designer about possibly reducing the font-size and/or reflowing the layout to allow for better readability.</Paragraph>
