## Basic Usage

### Labeling

If the visible text does not sufficiently describe the context for screen-reader users, you should provide an alternative via `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby`, or via the use of the `screen-reader` utility class.

```Message { "props": { "kind": "info", "className": "mb-16" } }
If another part of the page controls what appears in the status indicator, you should make the relationship explicit with the `aria-controls` attribute.
```

### Overriding the Element

Use `tag` to set the element that StatusIndicator uses.

To accomodate a variety of use cases, any HTML element may be used, but relevant [text-level semantic elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#text-level-semantics) or [ARIA roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#role_definitions) are encouraged along with the use of appropriate labelling as described above.

An example using `aria-label` and `role`.

```Message { "props": { "kind": "warning", "className": "mb-16" } }
An element with role "status" shouldn't receive focus as a result of change in status.
```

```jsx
<StatusIndicator kind="positive" aria-label="Order: " role="status">Complete</StatusIndicator>
```

An example using the `screen-reader` utility class.

```jsx
<StatusIndicator kind="positive">
  <span class="screen-reader">Status: </span>
  Complete
</StatusIndicator>
```

## Kinds

There are 3 kinds available that apply corresponding background and border color to the indicator dot.

### Positive

Use when a process is completed and successful.
```jsx
<StatusIndicator kind="positive">
  <span class="screen-reader">Status: </span>
  Complete
</StatusIndicator>
```

### Callout

Use when a process is in an in-between state where the outcome is not yet known.
```jsx
<StatusIndicator kind="callout">
  <span class="screen-reader">Status: </span>
  Pending
</StatusIndicator>
```

### Negative

Use when the process is stopped, cancelled, or there is an error.
```jsx
<StatusIndicator kind="negative">
  <span class="screen-reader">Status: </span>
  Cancelled
</StatusIndicator>
```
