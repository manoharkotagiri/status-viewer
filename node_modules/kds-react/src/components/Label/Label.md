## Basic Usage

Wrap controls in the `<Label />` component.

```jsx
<Label className="mb-8">
    <Checkbox />
    Dogs
</Label>

<Label className="mb-8">
    <RadioButton name="radiogroup1" />
    Yes
</Label>

<Label className="mb-16">
    <Toggle />
    Enable Feature
</Label>

<Label className="mb-16">
    Favorite Fruit
    <Input />
</Label>

<Label className="mb-16">
    Favorite Animal
    <Select>
        <option>Cat</option>
        <option>Dog</option>
        <option>Rock</option>
    </Select>
</Label>
```

## Single Inputs with Left Labels

A solitary `<Input>` can have a label that is placed to the left.

```jsx
<Label leftOfInput>
    Search
    <Input />
</Label>
```

## Using `htmlFor`

> **Note:** If you do not nest the control within the label, you are responsible for the properly laying out the label and the control per the design mock.

```jsx
<Label htmlFor="fruit" className="mb-8">Favorite Fruit</Label>
<Input id="fruit" />
```

## Long-form Label

```jsx
<Label className="mb-16">
    <Checkbox />
    I accept the terms and agreements of the contract, herein and thus forth defined by The Kroger Co., its constituents or partners.
</Label>

<Label className="mb-16">
    <RadioButton name="radiogroup2" />
    I accept the terms and agreements of the contract, herein and thus forth defined by The Kroger Co., its constituents or partners.
</Label>

<Label className="mb-16">
    <Toggle />
    I accept the terms and agreements of the contract, herein and thus forth defined by The Kroger Co., its constituents or partners.
</Label>

<Label className="mb-16">
    I accept the terms and agreements of the contract, herein and thus forth defined by The Kroger Co., its constituents or partners.
    <Input />
</Label>

<Label>

        <option>Snarfulmicken</option>
        <option>Prinplenickle</option>
    </Select>
</Label>
```
