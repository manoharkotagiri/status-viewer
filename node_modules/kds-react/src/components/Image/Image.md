## Default Image

When an image is provided to `Image`, it will first display what's called a _skeleton_ as the image loads in the background. Once the image has successfully loaded, the skeleton is replaced with the loaded image.

`Image` behaves like a standard `<img />` tag, in that it will conform to whatever sizing its parent defines (as illustrated in the examples) and accepts image attributes such as `srcset` and `loading`.

```jsx
const isFT = window.location.search === '?FT=1';

render(<div style={{ height: '500px' }}>
  <Image
    src={isFT ? "" : "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1551189014-fe516aed0e9e"}
    alt="Hang in there."
  />
</div>)
```

## Skeleton

A skeleton displays before any other image state while the image is being loaded. Once the image has been loaded (or if the image fails to load), the skeleton placeholder will be replaced with the appropriate image state.

```jsx
const isFT = window.location.search === '?FT=1';

render(<div style={{ height: '500px' }}>
  <Image
    src={isFT ? "" : "https://httpbin.org/drip?duration=99999"}
    alt="Skeleton loading state"
  />
</div>)
```

## Broken Image

If an image errors out, a broken image icon will be displayed.

```jsx
const isFT = window.location.search === '?FT=1';

render(<div style={{ height: '500px' }}>
  <Image src={isFT ? "" : "about:blank"} alt="Broken image state"/>
</div>)
```

## No `src` Provided

If no `src` is passed to `Image`, a generic groceries icon will be displayed. An empty `src` prop must be present for this to work.

```jsx
<div style={{ height: '500px' }}>
  <Image src="" alt="Image URL not provided" />
</div>
```

If the generic groceries icon doesn't fit your needs, the icon can be changed using the `icon` prop.

```jsx
<div style={{ height: '500px' }}>
  <Image src="" icon={IconDelivery} alt="Image URL not provided" />
</div>
```

## Lazy Loading

Setting the `loading` prop to `"lazy"` works even in browsers that don't natively support the attribute, as long as they support Intersection Observers. If they support neither, images will load after `componentDidMount()`.

In the current implementation, images start loading when they're 3000px from the edge of the page. This is based on [Chrome's default values for lazy-loading images](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/third_party/blink/renderer/core/frame/settings.json5?l=971-1003&rcl=e8f3cf0bbe085fee0d1b468e84395aad3ebb2cad) on a 4G connection. If you refresh the page, you should be able to see that some of these images load as you scroll down.

```jsx
const isFT = window.location.search === '?FT=1';

render(<div>
  <div style={{ height: '500px' }}>
    <Image
      src={isFT ? "" : "https://placekitten.com/500/500"}
      alt="This cute kitten is here to tell you about lazy loading!"
      loading="lazy"
    />
  </div>
  <div style={{ height: '500px' }}>
    <Image
      src={isFT ? "" : "https://placekitten.com/501/500"}
      alt="As is this ball of fluff."
      loading="lazy"
    />
  </div>
  <div style={{ height: isFT ? '10000px' : '500px' }}>
    <Image
      src={isFT ? "" : "https://placekitten.com/502/500"}
      alt="I wanted to use placedog.net, but their images break in IE11."
      loading="lazy"
    />
  </div>
  <div style={{ height: '500px' }}>
    <Image
      src={isFT ? "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==" : "https://placekitten.com/503/500"}
      className="lazyTesting"
      alt="Meow."
      loading="lazy"
    />
  </div>
</div>)
```
