## ToastProvider

`ToastProvider` is a global component that contains the expected behavior for rendering multiple Toasts. To use this component, it must wrap the content of the code within the site/application where you want a `Toast` to render.

Because a `ToastProvider` manages the state of each `Toast`, **only one `ToastProvider` component should ever be used**. If more than one `ToastProvider` appears on a page, you run the risk of having multiple instances of Toasts that stack on top of each other.

A `ToastProvider` requires a `ToastConsumer` component to  pass its add function on to its child components.

## ToastConsumer

`ToastConsumer` can be added anywhere within the `ToastProvider` component where a `Toast` needs to be rendered.

While a single `ToastProvider` is needed to render a Toast, you can include many `ToastConsumers` if needed.

`ToastConsumer` accepts children, but it expects those children to be a function that takes a context object with its defined add method on it. This context object is defined in the `ToastProvider`.

```jsx
<ToastProvider>
  <ToastConsumer>
    {(add) => (
      <Button
        data-testid="toast-button"
        kind="secondary"
        onClick={() =>
          add({
            kind: 'warning',
            heading: 'Warning',
            text: 'This toast is too hot to handle.'
          })
        }
      >
        Create Toast
      </Button>
    )}
  </ToastConsumer>
</ToastProvider>
```

## Toast Kinds

**Note:** The following `Toast` examples have a class of `relative` added to them so they render correctly in the example blocks.

### Success

```jsx
<Toast kind="success" heading="Success" className="relative">
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit.
</Toast>
```

### Error

```jsx
<Toast kind="error" heading="Error" className="relative">
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
</Toast>
```

### Info

```jsx
<Toast kind="info" heading="Info" className="relative">
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur.
</Toast>
```

### Warning

```jsx
<Toast kind="warning" heading="Warning" className="relative">
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
</Toast>
```
