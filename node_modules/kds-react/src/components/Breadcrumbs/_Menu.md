A composite component used by `BreadcrumbMenu` for composing the intermediate/collapsed breadcrumbs and cloning those breadcrumbs with an onClick handler for hiding the menu when a breadcrumb is clicked.

## Menu example with three links, the first of which has onClick behavior

`Menu` renders children in a `<menu>` that is absolutely positioned and z-indexed above normal content.

The onChildClick prop will be automatically added to the child nodes by using React.cloneElement().

```jsx
<span
  style={{
    backgroundColor: 'darkseagreen',
    height: '20rem',
    display: 'inline-block'
  }}
>
    <span
      className='relative'
      style={{ backgroundColor: 'cornsilk' }}
    >
        The menu will be positioned at the bottom of the nearest positioned ancestor.
        <Menu
            onChildClick={(event) => alert(
                `The onChildClick handler was called on the ${event.type} event.`
            )}
        >
            <Link
                onClick={(event) => alert(
                    `The onClick handler was called on the ${event.type} event.`
                )}
            >
                Item One
            </Link>
            <Link>Item Two</Link>
            <Link>Item Three</Link>
        </Menu>
    </span>
    <p>Other content that may be obscured by the menu.</p>
</span>
```
