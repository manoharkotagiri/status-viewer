A composite component used by `Breadcrumb` for handling the visibility behavior of the `Menu` for intermediate/collapsed breadcrumbs.

## BreadcrumbMenu example with three links, the first of which has onClick behavior

```jsx
<BreadcrumbMenu>
    <Link
        onClick={(event) => alert(
            `Both the hide function and this arrow function are called on the ${event.type} event.`
        )}
    >
        Item One
    </Link>
    <Link>Item Two</Link>
    <Link>Item Three</Link>
</BreadcrumbMenu>
```
