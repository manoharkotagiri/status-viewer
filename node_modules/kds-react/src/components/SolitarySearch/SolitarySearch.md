## Basic Usage

Provide an `onSearch` callback prop to listen for the search submission. The `onSearch` callback provides the search term as the first argument, and the event as the second argument.

```jsx
<SolitarySearch
    aria-label="Search for products"
    placeholder="Search for products"
    name="search"
    onSearch={
        (term, event) => console.log({ term, event })
    }
/>
```

## Accessibility
Remember to set `role="search"` on the form. This helps with accessibility.

```jsx
<Form role="search" onSubmit={ (formData) => alert(`Form Submitted: ${formData.search}`) }>
    <SolitarySearch
        aria-label="Search for products"
        placeholder="Search for products"
        name="search"
    />
</Form>
```

## Sizes

Standard

```jsx
<SolitarySearch
    aria-label="Search for products"
    placeholder="Search for products"
    name="search"
/>
```

Compact

```jsx
<SolitarySearch
    aria-label="Search for products"
    placeholder="Search for products"
    name="search"
    compact 
/>
```

## Inside a Form

If you put `SolitarySearch` within a form, by default, pressing Enter or clicking the Search Button will submit the form. Use `event.preventDefault()` if you need to stop form submission.

The `SolitarySearch` should be the only input in the form.
```jsx
<Form role="search" onSubmit={ (formData) => alert(`Form Submitted: ${formData.search}`) }>
    <SolitarySearch 
        aria-label="Search for products"
        placeholder="Search for products"
        name="search"    
    />
</Form>
```
## Inverse Style
The inverse style should be used on dark backgrounds and will not have a border.

Standard

```jsx
<Form style={{ backgroundColor: '#0068B3', padding: '16px' }} role="search" onSubmit={ (formData) => alert(`Form Submitted: ${formData.search}`) }>
    <SolitarySearch
        inverse
        aria-label="Search for products"
        placeholder="Search for products"        
        name="search"
    />
</Form>
```

Compact

```jsx
<Form style={{ backgroundColor: '#0068B3', padding: '16px' }} role="search" onSubmit={ (formData) => alert(`Form Submitted: ${formData.search}`) }>
    <SolitarySearch
        inverse
        compact
        aria-label="Search for products"
        placeholder="Search for products"
        name="search"
    />
</Form>
```
