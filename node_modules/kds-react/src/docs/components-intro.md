Components come in two patterns:
- [Primitives](#Primitives)
- [Composites](#Composites)

# Primitives

Primitives are components that are the basic building blocks for larger components. Often they represent a native DOM element like Button or Label, but can also be a very simple custom component like Favorite, which renders a button.

All primitive components in kds-react follow the [Single Element Pattern](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/introducing-the-single-element-pattern-dfbd2c295c5d?gi=8c9d1cec9e71).

They:
- Only render a single element.
- Pass all props onto that element, including merging `className` and handlers.
- Strive to reduce custom props, instead opting to utilize native attributes.
- **Never** break the app, even if you don't pass required props.

# Composites

Composite components are made up of other primitive or composite components. Because of this they do not follow the Single Element Pattern.

They typically will have a more complex prop API or specific ways to use them.
