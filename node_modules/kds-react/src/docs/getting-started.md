# CSS Setup

In your application you'll want to import our styles.
`kds-reset.css` includes normalize.css and a thin layer of opinionated resets (check for compatibility with existing CSS).
`kds-styles.css` includes our font stack and our componentsâ€™ CSS.
`kds-utils.css` includes our utility classes.

In your App.js, add the following lines:

```js static
import "kds-react/kds-reset.css"
import "kds-react/kds-styles.css"
import "kds-react/kds-utils.css"
```

__IMPORTANT:__ Esperanto has its own CSS reset and brings in our `kds-styles.css` and `kds-utils.css` so skip this step if your page is in Esperanto. Otherwise duplicate CSS will be shipped which will negatively affect the performance of the website.

# Layout Utility Classes

KDS React recommends using our layout utility classes in your App. They make it easy to quickly lay out the elements that make up your pages and custom components.

Once you've imported `kds-react/kds-utils.css` (not necessary if your page is in Esperanto), you are ready to use utility classes.

```jsx
<div className="flex flex-col items-center p-16">
    <Heading level={1} className="mb-16">Layout with Utilities</Heading>
    <Paragraph className="mb-16">Using layout utilities is fast and fun</Paragraph>
    <Button>Sign Me Up!</Button>
</div>
```
