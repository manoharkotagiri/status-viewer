`kds-react/polyfills` are necessary for some components to work properly in specific browsers. Since polyfills are traditionally managed by implementing platforms/teams we do not load them directly in our code, we instead export them individually to be comsumed by teams that want to import our polyfills.

## Import all polyfills

```js static
import 'kds-react/polyfills'
```

## Import only the ones you need

### **custom-event**

*Required for Form input validations in IE 11*
```js static
  import 'kds-react/polyfills/custom-event'
```

To see a list of the polyfills, open the [`polyfills`](https://gitlab.kroger.com/kds/kds-react/blob/main/polyfills) directory.
