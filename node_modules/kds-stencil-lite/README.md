# Overview

## What is kds-stencil-lite?

`kds-stencil-lite` consists of a subset of components from the main `kds-stencil` library. The purpose of this library is to contain only the components that do not exist in `kds-react`, so that React bindings can be generated and ultimately exposed through `kds-react`.

## How does it work?

We treat `kds-stencil-lite` as if it were its own separate Stencil library, but use relative symbolic linking into the parent project to expose only the components we want to expose. Therefore, the only changes that should occur within `kds-stencil-lite` are the addition or removal of symbolic links. When building, the `kds-stencil-lite` build process will generate React bindings in the `kds-stencil-react` project that needs to be at the same folder level as `kds-stencil`.

# Guide

When looking to expose components in `kds-stencil-lite` there are three major steps to follow.

## 1. Add component to components.json

Add the name of the component you want to expose to `components.json`.

## 2. Build the project and check the React bindings.

With the symbolic links created we can now build the project and check its output.

1. At the root of the `kds-stencil-lite` directory run: `npm run build`
2. When the build finishes, check your `kds-stencil-react-lite` project to ensure the new bindings were generated.
  - See the readme.md in `kds-stencil-react-lite` for more details.


## 3. Publish kds-stencil-lite

Since `kds-stencil-lite` is a direct dependency of `kds-stencil-react-lite`, we need to publish a new version of `kds-stencil-lite` before we move forward with `kds-stencil-react-lite`.

After ensuring the bindings for `kds-stencil-react-lite` are properly generating, update the version number in the `kds-stencil-lite` package.json to the appropriate next version. Push all changes up to a branch named `lite-release-x.x.x`

Once code review is complete, run the manual publish step in the pipeline to build and publish the new version. Then, merge your branch into `develop`.
